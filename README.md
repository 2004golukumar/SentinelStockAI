🚀 Problem Statement
Retail businesses constantly struggle with balancing stock levels—too much inventory leads to high storage costs, while too little results in stockouts and missed sales. The traditional methods used for inventory forecasting and pricing decisions are manual, slow, and reactive, making them inefficient in handling real-time demand fluctuations.

Key challenges faced by businesses:

Unreliable demand forecasting → leading to overstocking or shortages.

Manual stock monitoring → causing delays and discrepancies.

Static pricing models → failing to adapt to changing customer behavior.

Uncoordinated supplier management → resulting in slow restocking and delivery delays.

To solve these issues, we propose an AI-driven Multi-Agent System that automates demand prediction, inventory tracking, and pricing optimization, ensuring a proactive, data-driven approach to retail management.

🔍 Proposed Solution Overview
This project introduces an intelligent Multi-Agent System that enables autonomous collaboration between AI agents to streamline inventory management. Each agent specializes in forecasting demand, adjusting prices, monitoring stock levels, and coordinating with suppliers, ensuring a seamless retail supply chain.

🧠 Agent Roles & Responsibilities
✅ Demand Forecasting Agent – Uses machine learning to predict sales trends.
✅ Inventory Monitoring Agent – Tracks stock levels and triggers restocking alerts.
✅ Pricing Optimization Agent – Dynamically adjusts product prices based on demand and competition.
✅ Supplier Coordination Agent – Manages order placements and supply chain logistics.
✅ Coordinator Agent – Acts as a control hub, ensuring smooth communication between all agents.

🔄 Interaction Flow
1️⃣ Predict demand → 2️⃣ Monitor inventory levels → 3️⃣ Trigger restocking if needed → 4️⃣ Optimize pricing → 5️⃣ Update inventory system
