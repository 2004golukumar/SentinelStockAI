ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

ðŸš€ Introduction
AI-SupplySync is a multi-agent AI system designed to optimize inventory management, demand forecasting, pricing automation, and supplier coordination. By leveraging AI-driven decision-making, this system helps businesses reduce stockouts, minimize overstocking, and enhance supply chain efficiency.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
Managing inventory efficiently is a major challenge in the retail and supply chain industry. Businesses struggle with stockouts (running out of popular items), leading to lost sales, and overstocking (excess inventory), which increases holding costs. Traditional inventory management methods rely on manual forecasting, periodic stock audits, and reactive pricing adjustments, making them inefficient and prone to errors.

Without an AI-driven, proactive approach, businesses face:

Inaccurate demand forecasting, leading to supply mismatches.

Delayed inventory updates, causing stock discrepancies.

Inefficient pricing strategies, affecting sales and profit margins.

Lack of supplier coordination, resulting in slow replenishment cycles.

This project aims to automate and optimize inventory management using a multi-agent AI system, ensuring real-time tracking, accurate demand forecasting, and dynamic decision-making.
